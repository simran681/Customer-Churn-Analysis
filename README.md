**Customer Churn Analysis with R
Project Overview**
In this project, I led a comprehensive analysis of customer churn to understand the factors contributing to customer attrition and provide insights for developing effective retention strategies. The analysis was conducted using the R programming language, leveraging statistical analysis techniques and machine learning models.

**Key Contributions**
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

**Collected customer data from relevant sources.**
Preprocessed the data to ensure quality and consistency.
**Statistical Analysis Techniques:**
Utilized various statistical analysis techniques to explore and understand the patterns in customer behavior.
**Machine Learning Models:**
Developed machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Evaluated model performance and fine-tuned parameters for better accuracy.
**Identification of Key Patterns:**
Discovered crucial patterns in customer behavior.
Established a correlation between the onboarding experience and churn rate.

**Tools and Technologies Used
R:**
Utilized R for data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization.
